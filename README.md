This editor is not production ready yet!
For latest development news look at [commits](https://github.com/valdisvi/espeak-ng-jeditor/commits/master) and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). 
For production purposes you can use older snapshot of [espeak-ng-editor](https://github.com/valdisvi/espeak-ng-espeakedit)!

##Building

### espeak-ng
_eSpeakNG Java Editor relies on libraries of eSpeakNG, which have to be recompiled with custom settings._
Clone [eSpeakNG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/) project and [solve dependencies](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/#dependencies):

(To be sure) install additional packages:

```
sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0 libportaudio2 sox libwxgtk3.0-dev libportaudio-dev
```

When invoke building of `espeak-ng` project add additional `-fPIC` flags to compiler, e.g. by compiling in following way:


```
./autogen.sh
CFLAGS='-fPIC' ./configure --prefix=/usr
make -B
```

### espeak-ng-jeditor
Clone [espeak-ng-jeditor](https://github.com/valdisvi/espeak-ng-jeditor) project.
_Note that `espeak-ng` and `espeak-ng-jeditor` projects should be subfolders of common folder!_

Compile customized shared library by executing Bash script in `espeak-ng-jeditor` project folder:

```
./updateJNIchanges.sh
```
To rebuild Java classes, run Maven task:

```
mvn compile
```
