Currently translation is very raw and pattern is ugly and stupid as hell (but it works).
Menus are translated from left to right e.g. File -> Speak -> Voice etc.

If there is a sub-menu then its' content will be translated first e.g. 
Voice-> Select Voice... -> Select Voice Variant... Select Voice ->English ->Russian ->Latvian ->Polish AND ONLY THEN Options,
so keep the order or it will not work properly (or rework the translating pattern to something more beautiful)

ALSO: there is some kind of encoding issue with files saved on Linux OS and then opened on Win, be aware.
